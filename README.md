# Python at Twist Bioscience
## Improving performance with Rust

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Markov chain in Python and an equivalent implementation in Rust, along with Python bindings.

Example English text can be found in ``corpus.txt``, which was extracted from the ["Reuters-21578" dataset](http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/) using a simple python script (``python/process_reuters.py``).

For more information, see [the presentation](https://github.com/Twistbioscience/pycon-rust/blob/master/Python_at_Twist-Improving_Performance_with_Rust.pdf).

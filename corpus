Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review
The dry period means the temporao will be late this year
Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures
Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end
In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment

The Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said
The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president
White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases
Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month
The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair
Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high
Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week

American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock
American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express
The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend
American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity
At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts
Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant
It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions
Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff

Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters
GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen
The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March
If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up
However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less
GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said

The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil

processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said

With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins
But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added

Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum
However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight
Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said
Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate
But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics
Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later
Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said
Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package
If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said

Embassy says in a new report
To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment

DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc
They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality
This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties
Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal
But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier
But Japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche

American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place
Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm
There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said
American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement

To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling
Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday
Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president
It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition

More than two mln tonnes of surplus maize dotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country
Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly
Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as European countries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where the United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry
But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added
Rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers
While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification
The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops, such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February

Intel will customize those designs and sell them to others

A much faster turnarouond time, and much lower development costs, will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed

He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt, create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems
each year
The Bank of England proposed that banks in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets
In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage
The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said
The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year
Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues
However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk
Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms
But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle
Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently
After that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value
The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities, revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said
It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act, aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks
However, preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed, it said
They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities, and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks
Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed
and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees
local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment

Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said
But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said
Hutton said
The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill
Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures
This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination
Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said
Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said

Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december
The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said
He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales
Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil
But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts
Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart
Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments

But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short

Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said
Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said
In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions
It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said
It is too difficult to forecast now
The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas
Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise
Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed
The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September
More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine
In that case quotas could come into force during the summer
A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now
At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability
Legislation to implement the first stage of a promised sweeping new regulatory framework for the Canadian banking system was presented in the House of Commons, the finance department said

Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets
Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program
That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low
Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added
Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton

The Bundesbank is planning changes in the system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument, central bank officials said
Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently, enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly
The changes will probably come into force in April
Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business
The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself, in a process legally comparable to direct debiting
At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday
But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary
Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical, with no direct implications for interest rates
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago, and praised their flexibility
The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible, banking economists said
By speeding up the tender process, they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks, to respond to changing money market conditions
The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest rates, he said
There were seven selling days in both periods

The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego

Few new wells now are being drilled
Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association
While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell
Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said
The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said
So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled
No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said
Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production

The easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency, bond managers and traders said

The department said the acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public interest
The department had given its tentative approval of the acquisition in January
The department said it decided to make final its tentative decision after reviewing the public response to it
The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North America, which currently is not operating but plans to start service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those markets by other carriers
The agency said Air North America provided no support for its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers monopoly power in some markets
The transportation agency said Air North America also failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from increasing their service
The transportation department also rejected a request by the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to require protections for PSA workers
The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such protections

A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines
Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle
Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster
But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs
Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans

One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden

Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said
Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar
However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether
The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there
They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington
The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders
Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals
The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets

The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid
Icahn was unavailable for comment
Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged
Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone

Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer
Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated
TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions
Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said

farm programs, policymakers and their advisers here are citing trading in options contracts as an alternative to federal income and price supports
Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that the government could get out of guaranteeing minimum support prices if farmers systematically used options contracts to protect themselves against vacillating market prices
Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the benefits of price support programs without entailing the cost to taxpayers
Interest in promoting understanding of options trading among farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed change in agricultural policy that would have the effect of exposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations in income subsidies
Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price stabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency payments, equal to the difference between a set target price and the higher of the support price or market price
Sen

At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus
Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable
He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets

European Community Commission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan for changes to Community financing
In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves pruning their own spending
Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the EC should be based on their gross national product instead of on the amount of value added tax they receive
He said this would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of sharing the financial burden
He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about increased payments, he had told some heads of government the Community needs more money
Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes

There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement, INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said
The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October
Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings
At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week
Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances
At present, if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months, the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council
Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more
Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact
The company also reported some upswing in demand for its components and service parts

Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered
However, the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more likely from late July on
Although flowering was good following the start of the rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers, the sources said
However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in mature fruit from August through September
Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans
Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared
Because of the high turnover of beans this year, significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses
Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals

The legislation would require Congress to approve all subsidies on loans, to sell off many loans to the private sector shortly after they are made and to buy private reinsurance for many guaranteed loans
White House officials estimated reinsurance premiums  could amount to six billion dlrs a year to private companies
The bill would make little impact on the federal deficit or payroll, officials said
The legislation would not in itself alter the terms of federal credit programs
But officials said they would be pleased if Congress tightened some programs after seeing their true cost set out in the budget
The program would call for the immediate sale of many newly made direct federal loans, but would no effect existing federal loan portfolios
Some of these are already proposed to be sold off under previous administration programs
Exempt from the sale requirement would be loans made under the Commodity Credit Corp commodity loan program, which the government considers to be a commodity purchase program rather than a credit program, and defaulted guaranteed loans, which the government considers to be the same as direct loans

The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence of the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery of their loans, Dome said
Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity conversion options and reclassification to lower interest bearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives
The various conversion rates remain to be set through negotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predict the extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and the amount of dilution that may result
Converting debt to common shares after the plan is implemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Dome said
Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan before it is put in place
To achieve a stable operating base for the company, the plan provides for deducting operating costs, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses before the remaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Dome said
The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate the business as efficiently as possible, it said
As the company previously said, debt payments from cash flow be divided into two broad categories, secured and unsecured creditors
Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional unsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold private debt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets
Any institutional lender also has the option of taking all or part of its debt in common shares
To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome said they can also convert all or part of their debt to common shares when the plan is implemented
Any debt leftover would be exchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate linked to oil prices
Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by the assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula, the company said

Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans

It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz
Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit, the paper said
None of the new missiles had been fired yet, it added
The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had installed new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had warned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping
Yugoslav trade union leaders are touring the country in an attempt to quell a wave of strikes following a partial wages freeze, official sources said
Eyewitnesses in the northern city of Zagreb reported far more police on the streets than normal after the city and areas nearby experienced the biggest wave of strikes in the country in recent memory
National newspapers in Belgrade have given few details of the strikes
But Zagreb papers said thousands of workers went on strike and thousands more were threatening action over pay cuts
Official sources said there were also strikes at a Belgrade medical centre, a food factory in Sambor, and enterprises in Nis, Leskovac and Kraljevo, as well as other towns
They said national union officials were travelling throughout the country to speak to meetings in an attempt to restore calm
But trade union leaders were avoiding making statements to the press and had not made their stand on the strikes clear
Western diplomats said the strikes appeared to be spontaneous and without any unified orchestration

Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices
The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax
They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs
It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States
The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway
The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom
Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected

He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late Friday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other members of the Philippine delegation
But one senior banker said he too was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly by the end of the week
Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest margin above LIBOR
The Philippines would conserve foreign exchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the need to seek new bank loans
But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original form, fearing regulatory and accounting problems
They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that interest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other debtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said
But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was still a sticking point
The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the third
The proposal will go to parliament for final approval

A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said

Bankers expect rule changes this year
Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said
But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges
Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps
But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk
But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said
May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said

Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this
In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons
Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output
Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices
Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said
In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said
Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said

Preparations for the launch of a Swiss options and futures exchange, billed as the first completely electronic market of its kind, are at an advanced stage, according to members of the project team
There will be no physical exchange floor and both trading and clearing systems will be completely automated
These innovations included the introduction last October of continuous trading in major shares, plans to establish a single continuously updated Swiss share index from next month to supplement the various indices produced by the major banks at the close of business, and experiments in electronic trading
Banks themselves last year took the initiative of launching covered warrants on the shares of other Swiss companies
The computer terminals on which business will be conducted will be confined to Switzerland
Formal applications are not due until next month but a preliminary survey completed by the Soffex project team this week showed strong interest in membership
Hans Kaufmann, who follows Swiss equities for Bank Julius Baer, says a regulated traded options exchange should boost foreign interest in Swiss shares and possibly increase bourse turnover generally
The possibility of protecting portfolios by hedging should attract Swiss institutional investors, Kaufmann added
Soffex is a private company set up by the five major Swiss banks and the bourses of Zurich, Geneva and Basle
An options contract on the new Swiss share index should follow within six months but trading in financial futures will be delayed until an unspecified future date
Options on foreign shares may also be added later
Participants will be either brokers or dealers, operating in the market through computer terminals in their own offices
Trading must be conducted exclusively through the exchange
Exchange membership is open to banks, traders and brokerage firms with an office in Switzerland, while Clearing Members must be recognised as banks under Swiss law
Most of the electronic clearing functions will be carried out overnight
This reflects the fact that Swiss shares often cost thousands of francs

Japanese banks may have to realize significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market, bankers said
Ministry sources said the Ministry has yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing the perpetual floating rate notes they hold
Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the current market price, whichever is lower, bankers said
The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using such quotations, one official said
But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign portfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said
The acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price, whatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in the current fiscal year

The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said
Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated
This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work
A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend
Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder
On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows
The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices
Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given
The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets
Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday
Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market
The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers
The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there
In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers

But he told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda that contamination of snow around the plant was within safety levels and some of it had already been absorbed into the soil
Snowfall this winter had been greater than usual and a certain increase in the amount of radiation in the water was inevitable
But contamination would be within the permissible limits, Sytnik said
The banks of the river Pripyat, which flows near the plant, had been reinforced to prevent it bursting its banks when the thaw began this spring, he added

Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States
The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices, but would not automatically set off retaliation

Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry
Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said
He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin
This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south
He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year

The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said
He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary
In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said
First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses
Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established
Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones

The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said
The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said
The proposal involved three key principles
First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said
Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said
After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal
Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said
Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change

Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company
However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how high bidding for the company would go and whether the company would agree to a takeover
The company responded that the proposal would be submitted to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been made on a sale of the company
They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level would be chancy since it will take a long time for any transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals necessary for the broadcast properites
The company said it rejected the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co, its financial adviser
It said it would consider alternatives such as restructuring
Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft, which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp

He added that no extension or expansion of the research and development tax credit for business is expected since it would cost billions of dollars
housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth, economists said

And after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom
As a result, milder temperatures inflate the statistics
Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month

But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous beneficial impacts
price competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the government storage and handling costs
The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of the pik and roll marketing strategy
In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan rate
However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the program
OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto the market could cause prices to drop too low and government costs to increase too much
But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of certificates would be excessive

Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work
Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little investment opportunity
So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious
Firms number in the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said
Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now, but that time span appeared now to be too long
Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said
Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he added
Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese, the trading company official says

Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said
They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market
Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said
Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth
Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week
Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market
Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market

West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said
The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period
A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said
But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said
The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct
Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline
The company said the major causes for the reduction were an unfavorable LIFO adjustment and softer than projected sales in the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable weather

feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply
Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally placed on feed
Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas
The only statistics available are from some terminal markets which represent only a small percentage of the total cattle marketed
Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed, Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced
If the average weight is down, and there is no price weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct
Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large, he noted
Also, the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said
Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions
Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his area benefited from a dry, mild winter

corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said
By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed
If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis
The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage
With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said
A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said
The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said
corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said
But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system

In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry and shippers

Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said
The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba
With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting
Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume
The Federal Reserve Board has approved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase Commercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank holding company
But it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting activities
The Fed said the application was similar to that of Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was approved last December
Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks
In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was given authority to do
The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of total market share
Among the benefits for the public will be increased competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said

The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin American democracy and the danger that demagogues of either left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments
Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year, Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the administration on budget strategy
His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that Congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more seriously now than in the past
More worrisome for administration strategists is the possibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill

Property looks set to continue to provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia and Australia this year
A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economists around the region shows better returns are often more likely to come from buying and selling real estate than from rental income
But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach of foreign investors
The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will rise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in construction will limit increases in some areas
Property sales have become increasingly popular because in some sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several cities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields

Fresh talks have been scheduled for next Tuesday, he said
In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances
If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said
The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels
The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector
But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll
But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely
Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term

He also urged publicizing the comparative advantage of participation shares over ordinary shares for foreigners

British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture
He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture

Jefferies has resigned and intends to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities laws
The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the company ever engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the company ever sought or communicated insider information or violated ny trust of confidence placed in them by customers
The company said, without admitting any allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boyd Jefferies, Jefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies and Co also consented to an injunction barring any future securities laws violations
It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertake reviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and other control systems are in compliance with federal laws
The company said president and chief operating officer Frank E
Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executive officer
Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive
The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferies resulted from a transaction in which, on behalf of Jefferies and Co, he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlled by Ivan F
Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boesky firms
The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that following the loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mln dlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services, although Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as an offset to the losses it experienced
It said by rendering the involice, Boyd Jefferies apparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a false entry in its books, resulting in the charge, to which Boyd Jefferies will plead guilty, of aiding and abetting one of the Boesky firms in making false entries on its books
It was expected that the customer would be responsible for any loss on the shares and would also receive any profit, and because the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase, Boyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to finance the full purchase price for the shares in violation of margin requirements, the company said

Repligen Corp said it intends to file an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration seeking permission to test its AIDS vaccine in humans by the early summer
Repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of the year

Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver its vaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer than vaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found on the surface coat of the AIDS virus
Although there are several AIDS vaccine candidates, experts believe that development of a safe and effective vaccine is a long ways away
Moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine is only the first step in a long process of verifying if the vaccine actually will prevent infection

District Court in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies agreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a large chunk of stock being issued in a public offering
The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was being traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took place sometime last year when another unidentified company, which owned a controlling interest in the company, sold several million shares of the stock in a secondary public offering
The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said
The person who made the alleged stock manipulation agreement with Jefferies was also not identified
But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a phony invoice marked for investment banking services for the exact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the stock on the open market, the SEC said
The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed in the complaint, was made later by another unidentified person after Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, the SEC said
William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at the SEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealing the identities of other persons and companies involved in the stock manipulation scheme

Consumers may benefit from new telephone services if business restrictions against the regional Bell companies are eased, but safeguards against rate hikes may be needed, congressional and industry analysts say
District Court would help bring new services to markets that the regional firms are currently prohibited from serving, the analysts say
But consumer groups add that there is a danger the regional companies would raise rates to subsidize entry into new markets and safeguards would be needed to prevent that
In separate filings last week, the regional Bells asked Greene to remove restrictions, while industry and consumer groups including the Consumer Federation of America joined ATT in asking that all or most of them be retained
ATT does not offer computerized information services
Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to ease restrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said
However, a major concern among consumer groups and lawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those new businesses from higher charges to their customers

Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C
Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review
The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar
The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says
There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced
If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes
The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules
Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently

Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank

grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement
But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes
Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system
He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week
Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums
He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease
The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices
When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea

The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a floating rate note
The new financing for Italfunding, being syndicated among about five major international banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving facility with an average life of seven years and the facility will fund the loan
All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted outline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be negotiated on a bilateral basis
This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in this case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply on the international markets
At the same time, the deal benefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on the note facility, which is pure Italian risk
The bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged in Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would have been higher since the Italian banks would use a different source of funding

Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said
It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March, April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest

Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed
He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money
President Jose Sarney, whose handling of the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held private talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that government policies are leading to recession

It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said
Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but Brazil had a strong and broad economic base
With the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country
Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now
It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved
Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices
Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and creditor banks
One aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again

SGL officials could not be reached for comment
Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout
Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer
Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer
The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said
It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said
Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares
Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement
It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package
Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments

Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence

The business climate in West German manufacturing industry worsened slightly last month after deteriorating markedly in January, the IFO economic research institute said
It said its February survey showed firms were also increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the coming months, causing them to cut back production plans
IFO blamed the worsening of the business climate and outlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreign demand
More than a quarter of the firms polled said they thought orders in hand were insufficient
Overall, the business climate in February could be described as just short of satisfactory, IFO said
In a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, the institute said manufacturers of basic products judged the business climate to be slightly less favourable in February than in January
For the coming months they expect export prospects to dim and production to fall, it added
Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand but they increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient
The business climate in the capital goods industry was unchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said this was due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercial vehicles
Demand in the capital goods sector was generally described as weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had been in January, the institute said
The business climate in the consumer durables sector remained above the industry average in February
Carmakers were again positive about current business but forecast a slight worsening of business conditions in the near future

Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying

They said the cost to the economy had been too great
Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits
The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year
Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl

Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report
One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth
Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed
He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money

McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies
McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy

But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises
He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system
This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International Tin Agreement
It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said
Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations
Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers
Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added
Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more

Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview
sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday
He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject
Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons
sugar output severely reduced
Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon
Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls
Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production
cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain
But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy
Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year
Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program
He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved
He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market

USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government
The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending
Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow
Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said
Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash
Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate
However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said
The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year
Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters

Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel has suffered the consequences of the insider trading probe
To begin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the junk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexel might be in trouble
Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said
Drexel has set up its own subsidiary handling part of the insurance
American International Group and a group of British underwriters have handled the rest
Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the mergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said
However, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel had lost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases
But in citing results for the quarter, the company points mostly to other areas of success
Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena, market sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill

Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities of Des Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperative to replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company
Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans, but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediately for comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might be willing to band together
They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficient number of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements, obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms to handle futures trading
In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have been courting the individual coops, trying to obtain their business with low trading rates
Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark had no need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland
But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been able to meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark

The possibility that a major earthquake will strike Tokyo, causing corporate and financial ruin, haunts the worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled by Reuters
Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of a Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of the large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London
But it would plunge against other currencies
This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and assets in the Tokyo area
Banks would be left holding hundreds of billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans

Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly difficult to find reinsurance abroad
Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again, compounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in
Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and repatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment would seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets

The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system
When wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below
But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling
Meat Export Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about half those in Japan

In the majority of cases, people had perfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting the bank to know their identity, Oesch said
The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for a virtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with the new code

In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production
A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems
The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries
They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated
Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period
This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said
The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production
At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses
These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency
The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says
This was partly due to increased production in China and India

strategy for handling the debt crisis and added additional steps, like development by commercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform, can be undertaken
That particular development would maintain broad bank participation in new financing packages to debtors
Mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising new money packages may be essential for future bank syndications
In particular, Mulford said banks and debtor nations will increasingly move toward repricing, retiming or rescheduling agreements as an alternative to new loans
But for debtors with substantial financing needs, new lending will still be necessary, he said
Mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility as being far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimately taxpayers
As in the past, Mulford said progress must be founded on economic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors both to support those reforms and generate new growth

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said
Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow
They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said
As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said
Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said
Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said

But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round
But it also does not want them to fall
Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands
As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said
Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June

Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought
or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the  lucrative California market and the West Coast region
He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources
The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy
Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated
He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name
Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy
While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first

An administration working group, in an update of its report a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated
While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some sectors of the American economy
Some types of insurance, especially associated with environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies at any price, it said
The increased availability and the price stability for insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy restrictions, the study said

The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said
Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract
LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations
The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said
Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline
Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added
Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said
Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place
When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said
Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover
Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said

The current economy provides an environment of stable inflation, interest rates and energy costs, which gives food companies the flexibility to expand profit margins over a period of time, Page said
Lower commodity costs allow for further price flexibility, she added
Another plus is that increases in labor and packaging in the food industry have been minimal, she noted

The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations, probably later this week, exporters said
They added that Dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the Institute needs money to repay Central Governmnet funds released to finance IBC purchases at the guaranteed producer price
Although a vote in the Monetary Council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week, funds are still being released for subsequent approval
The sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end of this week
There is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the Brazilian economy, and the IBC could be awaiting clarification before making any move, the exporters said
Another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which, while not affecting current shipments, could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales
This would certainly be the case if the IBC was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale

Taiwan is planning to significantly relax foreign exchange controls within the next few months, but there is little prospect of a sudden outflow of capital, bankers and economists polled by Reuters said
He said controls could be retained for use in an emergency
Bankers and economists said they did not believe the government intended to drop all foreign exchange controls and allow the Taiwan dollar to be freely traded
But they said over the next few months certain restrictions will probably be eased to allow Taiwanese firms and individuals to hold part of their foreign exchange earnings for overseas investment
Bankers and economists also said it was likely the government would lift a ban on investment in foreign stocks
Taiwan allowed firms and individuals to invest in overseas government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit for the first time last year
Inflation is now running at about three pct
Mounting reserves are also seen as giving Washington leverage in its efforts to force Taiwan to boost the value of its currency to reduce the trade imbalance
Bankers said dropping foreign exchange restrictions was unlikely to lead to significant capital outflows because of the rising value of the Taiwan dollar

However, brokers said the market was unlikely to perform better than it has in the past year
Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the coming year the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twice and the inflow of funds would be slower
Brokers said their optimism about the market was based on the current low interest rates, the increasing propensity of the Japanese to save as the economy stagnates, the imminent introduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post office savings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks
They said Japanese with money to spare, and companies unwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the present climate of stagnant growth, would keep on snapping up stocks
He said Japan had to respond to international pressure to stimulate its domestic demand, buy more imports and establish itself as a supply base of capital
Brokers said banks and other financial institutions would be among the most popular shares this year
They also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan

Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations
Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed
The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades
Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations

Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling

International agreements exist for sugar and wheat
These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect statistics and draw up market analyses
Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat
An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups, made up of governments with advice from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber

One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said
Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said
With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days
When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return
Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said
Tomorrow it will be different
International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark

In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account
Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase
The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move
In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of funds
But quarter end pressures helped push up funds
The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year
They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not quickly boost their prime rates

Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy
But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller, who joined the board last August
He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the volatility of exchange rates
Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation
His idea, which many conservative economists find appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan
It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation, key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of the money supply
Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly
In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies
A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa
But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the monetary system, is also being widely questioned
Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also
For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy
Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement
The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems
He appears convinced that officials from West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing
The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates
He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis
In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes
He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities

A series of protests involving hundreds of thousands of farmers has disrupted rural towns since January as the growers blockade roads and bank offices with farm machinery
The state is a leading producer of grains and soybeans
Brazilian press reports say financial pressures have driven some farmers to suicide in recent weeks
But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them
But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added
The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year
The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops
To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy
Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it
Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices
But the government has ruled out a price rise
The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term
In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular
The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes
Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it
For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative
He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials
He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports

Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year

Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from the traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling, and some have even been making a loss on these operations
Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the Bosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to pay depositors real interest rates for the first time and profits started to fall
Previously, rates had been below inflation
As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have started moving into capital market operations to broaden their earnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a year ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange
Liberalisation went one step further last week when parliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public
Bankers said both benefited from trade finance and increased capital market operations

Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance sheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank to standardise accounting
Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory auditing by international accounting companies

Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump
Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date

Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said
Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded
A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause
The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak
Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said
Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said
Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said
The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said
Western economists who follow Yugoslav financial affairs said a similar deal would probably emerge from talks with commercial creditors at the end of this month

Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue
Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board
Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further
Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct
A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said
Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries

The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention
Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar

Now, there is no such consensus

refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump

Although other firms have developed such superconductive materials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire
Developing a superconducting material that works at room temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic worldwide scientific race
The main applications would be in super powerful magnets, small computers of immense power and speed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power, and electric generators which consume no power
Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines
But problems still have to be surmounted
This requires costly liguid gas coolants
Superconductors developed to date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current, only direct current, government scientists said

Several industrial nations are pressing the United States to consider whether its debt strategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needs to be strengthened, monetary sources say
Britain too is said to be concerned
But monetary sources said some nations want even more flexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to loans for debtor nations
There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too low and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for tawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased
Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments
Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States, acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments
Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is  particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks to lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say
banks are laying the groundwork for writing down their Brazilian loans
officials have generally praised most debtors for adopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral institutions for stepping up their lending
And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the Philippines have struck agreement with commercial banks stretching out debt repayments

The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt strategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to come up with more finance
That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West Germany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief

Japanese press reports said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his controversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread opposition even within his own party
The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax should be amended if there was anything wrong with it
Officials were not immediately available for comment
But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese people if they hated it
Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth
Resistance has spread from opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP
Some leading LDP candidates for the local polls have not asked Nakasone to make a campaign speech for them as they fear his presence would weaken their position in the elections

But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in regular ground roast types
General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help push coffee sales out of the doldrums
Sales show no signs of picking up
As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the brew
There are no other markets
In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular ground roast coffees produce
But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing structure prevails, industry sources said
There is no trade discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a special valve designed to keep the beans fresher
Thus, retail prices on gourmet coffee are now almost three times the price of green
Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference
And product manager Brown points to the success of more expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in restricted high income areas and are now available in almost every supermarket in the country

The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency

Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention
But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention
Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it
Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate
Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future

Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation
Congress
But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers, signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon
Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out
Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed
Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system
Official disputed the assessment that, with Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives
Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years
Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets

The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow
Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda
Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings
The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months
The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January
Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community

Stoltenberg noted that Brazil had agreed in January to work together with the banks but said this pledge had not yet been fulfilled
West German bankers also said then that Brazil should seek an understanding with the IMF
Stoltenberg said in Bonn today that he had already told Funaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake
Stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, the debt problems of a whole range of countries had recently become more difficult
He said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedly and that the refusal of some highly indebted countries to fulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the IMF was one reason for this
Many debtor countries had realised that it was not possible to mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments, without such policies, Stoltenberg said

To broaden their client and deposit base, some Japanese banks have taken equity in local banks
Tokai Bank, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have interests in small local banks

West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued
And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy
Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published
The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene
Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered
He said he had nothing further to add
Finance Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters yesterday that he hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction tax proposals today
Eyskens also said he would in the next few days announce plans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreign investors to reclaim witholding tax
Financial analysts said the current procedure is so slow that it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in the bond market
The sources said it was likely that this proposal and plans to simplify the witholding tax procedure would now be submitted together to the cabinet in several weeks

The price clampdown has occurred during a conservative backlash following the resignation in January of reformist Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, Western diplomats and Chinese sources say
A Chinese journalist said the reformers had underestimated the extent to which the public would tolerate price changes
The reformers think it vital to change a system under which prices often bear no relation to production costs
Sugar is an example
The journalist said the review was in part due to political factors
But the Western media is wrong to classify the leadership into reformers and conservatives

Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview
Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable
The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops
Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares
He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly
The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said
Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system

Abnormally high levels of radiation were found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow were advised this week
Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University, including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were found to be free of radiation, it said
The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts
Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected
Embassy spokesman said
Last month Turkey formally requested EC membership, receiving a polite reply from Brussels that the time was not ripe
Since then, government officials have stressed that, while membership was impossible, Switzerland should do everything possible not to be locked out when the trade barriers inside the EC come down
These areas, including pharmaceutical research and technological development, are the key to the economic future of Switzerland and the Community alike, he adds
The Swiss economy ministry has drawn up a detailed analysis of the EC White Paper on the internal market, outlining the Swiss response to each point
While some refer to a collective EFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerland may have act alone
The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have a severe impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carry most of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners
But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed to carry across a border have much less importance to Sweden or Finland
Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossing its borders with West Germany, France and Italy
The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would be that their divided interests might leave the EC free to set whatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them on other European states that wanted to trade

The Bank of Italy issued details of new bank capital adequacy requirements due to come into force in June, in a central bank circular

The total credit risk of an individual bank will be calcluated by assigning specific weights to the various categories of financial assets and off balance sheet assets
The weighting will be based essentially on credit risk and will not take into account guarantees, other forms of risk transfer or potential losses linked to exchange or interest rates
The Bank of Italy said it would set more stringent individual ratios for those banks running greater risks regarding items such as the quality, mobility and concentration of assets, and to liquidity and management adequacy
The new ratios will be applied to all banks operating in Italy
A transition period would be allowed but would not be more than four years
Italian branches of foreign banks will be exempted from the risk ratio when the parent banks are already subject to similar ratios but must comply with the gearing ratio
The Bank of Italy said the introduction of capital ratios aimed to further enhance capital adequacy at a time of increasing competitiveness and was a further step in bringing Italy into line with supervisory norms in other countries

Olin Corp said it was conducting an organizational restructuring of its defense systems group to meet growth plans
Agriculture Department official said
As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured products
However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product
Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees
However, the case of plywood was less clear
Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday
In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding plywood
However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer
The wood products company also said it expects to release first quarter results later this month

Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said
Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervision can be found without having to change the law again
The risk structure in banking is moving away from the model on which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said
Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net but the safety net has become a little too small, he said

Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates
Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy
The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy
Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation
The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down
The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said
Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy
Economy, he said
But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank
Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high
But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities

Norway will from June require finance institutions and insurance companies to report lending volume to the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bid to tighten domestic lending, Finance Ministry officials said
Norwegian Bank Association President Trond Reinertsen told Reuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks to transfer funds to financial and insurance companies for lending
Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan registration to transfer money for lending to finance and insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for lending in excess of government set ceilings
The new rule brings loan reporting requirements for insurance and finance companies in line with those already applied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said
Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped down on what it called excessive bank lending
They said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates

Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth
But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said
Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway
But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy
The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments
All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said

Japan should promote division of labour with its Asian neighbours, especially the newly industrialized countries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth, the Bank of Japan said in a report
Instead of trying to produce everything by itself, Japan should open up its market further to imports, transfer manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology transfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthly report
The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports manufactured goods to them
But this has resulted in an increase in their trade deficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asian nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like the United States

There is no evidence rules were broken
LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank
Their inspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany
German press reports have said some banks circumvented this rule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them
The banking regulations only cover banks
Company foreign exchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators
The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs that the regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible to instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports
The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from banks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely inspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods
But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors to detect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies and therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal
It would be up to the public prosecutors to order special checks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they said

Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said

They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas
However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season
There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa
Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean
Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again
It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April
The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage
Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available

But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco
American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings

It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions
Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments
It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends
Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow
To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off
Current account deficit
But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems
Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports
And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect
Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP
When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions
Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates
It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem
Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene
It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said
In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said

Arguments have already broken out over money
No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the former forest service, the analysts added
Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the only shareholder, retaining the right to order the new corporations to undertake certain projects although the full cost must be met by the state, the analysts said
Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would be held accountable for performance, with the government paying for projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons
This policy has already caused problems, the analysts added
For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several hundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate, further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under construction in Central Otago
Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs had decided last year that Luggate be built and it was important that the government honour its promises

But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said
The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business
Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added
Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing
Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said
Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the governorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan
The LDP and two centre parties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda, who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist parties
The proposed tax is a key campaign issue
Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido
It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese domestic demand and cut back on exports
Without the tax revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating the economy

They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances
The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services
The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting
In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement

The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said
Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings
GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what
One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state and often contain subsidies
The political meaning is evident
Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT
However, China would not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment
A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of grain it exported, because it had to make up the difference between a low world price and a high domestic price

Initially, the ministry is likely to bar corporate and individual investors due to their relative inexperience, and to limit trading to instruments like currency, stock indexes, time deposits and government debt futures, the sources said

At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair advantage in world financial markets
The technical banking talks coincided with, but were separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left Tokyo yesterday for South Korea
At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must put up to back up their loans
The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer, head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters
The two countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan
But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new regulations governing capital ratios last May
But, in tacit recognition of overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for Japanese banks with overseas branches
Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have capital ratios of around three pct
Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too high by the ministry
Japanese banks would never be able to realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say
Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise

Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact
The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday
Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates

Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy
Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly
In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows
Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports
The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate

AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances
AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague
Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat

Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable
The yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new, currency and bond analysts here said
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February
They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments

At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair advantage in world financial markets
The technical banking talks coincided with, but were separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left Tokyo yesterday for South Korea
At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must put up to back up their loans
The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer, head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters
The two countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan
But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new regulations governing capital ratios last May
But, in tacit recognition of overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for Japanese banks with overseas branches
Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have capital ratios of around three pct
Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too high by the ministry
Japanese banks would never be able to realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say
Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of their hidden reserves

Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders to strength in the personal computer market, inventory restocking and strong buying by distributors

Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession
The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said
Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others

The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago

All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment

But it should issue additional bonds to ensure a more stable source of funds, he said
Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the need for the government to float more bonds to raise funds needed for economic expansion
He said additional government borrowing would place no burden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excess funds and government bond prices have risen to record levels lately

Michio Watanabe, a Nakasone faction member and deputy secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, LDP, is one of those who believes he will survive
Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a mistake
A two or three pct tariff might have been easier to swallow, he said
A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister
But he would not bet on his chances of survival up until October
Masamichi Inoki, a senior fellow at the conservative Institute of Peace and Security, said he did not think Nakasone had suffered irreparable damage
In any event, the general belief now is that the five pct sales tax, as championed by Nakasone, is a dead issue but that an indirect tax, in another form, will be introduced by the LDP
The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of opinion, stating that Nakasone might well get another year to deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform
The government has to find a way of generating revenue to support an expected glut of elderly Japanese
And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an indirect tax, said Watanabe, a former Minister of International Trade and Industry

DAG will seek support from its members in the Bundesbank who are not directly affected by the negotiations
Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders, with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May
This would indicate the likelihood of high tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids for the export licences, traders said
The Ugandan government, in its four year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from dependence on coffee sales
The government also said in the plan, made available to Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit
The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the Produce Marketing Board
The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee farmers
Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment

Instead, they aimed to see that the price of the precious metal recuperated to adequate levels
El peruano did not specify what these levels were
El peruano quoted energy and mines minister Wilfredo Huayta as saying that Peru did not want to participate in speculative operations with silver

Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in continued production of gasoline due to the surplus
However, refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said
Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a major oil company said he believed that most companies are contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term
He said some refiners appear to be selling less aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the expected rise in demand this summer
Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the supply situation this summer
However, a planner at another major oil company said that although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output soon

But this growth depended largely on external factors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat said in its latest annual report on Sweden
It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in Sweden than in other OECD countries
Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which largely relies upon export markets, was losing market share
The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining economic growth in Sweden
It suggested that wage negotiations should be at least partly centralised to control the total wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels
The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic consumption for economic growth
It suggested there was room for reform in the tax system
Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending, especially in local government, to keep in line with its tighter fiscal policy, the report said
In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performance in the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country
Asked to explain the reason for his optimism, Fendt said they were estimating that in each of the last six months of the year the trade surplus would amount one billion dlrs

Agreements so far in the current West German wage round are neutral as far as inflation is concerned because of the strength of the mark, Schlesinger said
Wage agreements in the public service and engineering industry were relatively high in view of the stable cost of living
But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said

Ministers from the major trading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said
Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC
And EC products
She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue
The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers
The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations

Four trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action
His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later
Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said
The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules, he said
The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem
The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries

In order to seek common ground, de Keersmaeker plans to spend the whole of tomorrow in bilateral meetings with each of his colleagues in turn
Diplomats said although the ministers will meet together on Tuesday, de Keersmaeker is likely to conclude that further talks at the level of officials are necessary and that the hard bargaining will have to wait until May
The meeting will provide senior government officials with their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the dollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longer term, they said
The meeting will be held in Italy, they said, but gave no other details
The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency markets
But economists say the strategy has so far not worked
Trade deficit starts to fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink
Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system
Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological research programs and regional and social spending projects
Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members

CSR will shortly announce further details of the offer including a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement
Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options, the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer at the same price within six months of the closing date of the bid, the company said
Both option deals are subject to the approval of Monier shareholders except CSR and Redland
As previously reported, Redland and Monier had been discussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talks broke off two weeks ago
CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means of establishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials in which they both have interests
At the end of the offer, they will discuss how these interests may be developed

Good soaking rain is boosting the sugar cane crop in the key Mackay region of Queensland following a prolonged dry spell relieved only by intermittent falls, an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman told Reuters
The rains began late last week, developed into heavy downpours over the weekend and are continuing today, he said from Brisbane
The Mackay and Burdekin regions, which together grow about half the Australian cane crop, have been the Queensland cane areas hardest hit by unseasonal dry weather since December
The spokesman said the rain missed the Burdekin area, just to the north of the Mackay region on the central Queensland coastal fringe, although recent light showers have freshened the crop there
Preliminary crop estimates are expected to be available early next month, the spokesman said
The crush normally runs to around the end of December
Elsewhere in the sugar belt, the cane is doing well, with some mill areas expecting record crops, he said
Industry records show variations in the crop are not always mirrored in raws output

Attempts to hold currency rates rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said
The other danger was that money supply expansion could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its central bank being involved in the activity
Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another participating unit
Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement between central banks when speculative pressure moves a currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be near any allowed EMS limits
At the start of this year, central banks were very actively selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew

The resignation of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro is bound to focus attention on whether Brazil will now adopt a more flexible debt stance and move towards an accord with creditors, bankers and political analysts said
There was also a question of personal style
However, Funaro did not fall because he upset foreign bankers but rather because his Cruzado Plan price freeze last year was a massive flop, economically and politically
He argued that if Brazil sought the help of the IMF, the Fund would lay down conditions which would lead to recession
Diplomat here said the agreement had been extremely damaging for Funaro because it showed that cooperation with the IMF bore fruit
Brazil is now the only one of the three biggest Latin American debtors not to have a debt agreement
Some Brazilian opinion, particularly in the business community, is favourable to an IMF accord
A leading newspaper, Jornal do Brazil, carried a report from Washington over the weekend saying it was a myth the IMF brought recession and the best moment for an accord was now
As it happens, a routine IMF mission is visiting Brasilia
The government has repeatedly dismissed speculation it is considering any major change in debt policy and political analysts caution against expecting changes on the IMF issue
The government of President Jose Sarney has gained a reputation for chronic indecisiveness and some analysts believe the government will turn to the IMF only if it comes to the conclusion there really is no option
But such a policy shift looks more and more likely before too long in the eyes of many analysts
One major political obstacle, Funaro, is no longer in the picture and the economic pressures on Brazil are growing

Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later
Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said

Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia
He said local connections to the nation whose waters are being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the market
Tappmeyer, who is president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism
He added that international contractors will increasingly find their role restricted to regions that require special expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters
Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty providing financing out of cash flow
He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction costs
For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of rigs
But he said there will be a need for new, technologically advanced rigs within a few years
Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative
Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one
They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed in a notional common currency, are translated into the currencies of member states
West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area, saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations
The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options
But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge

Officials noted the study strongly underscores the need for action by West Germany and Japan

A Soviet geologist said scientists need to coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits to help identify global formations that would indicate other potential discoveries of oil and gas reserves
Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleum geology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the World Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be improved through new and more sophisticated technology
Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine unexplored regions
After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil production was increasing
When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal gasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves in the region
Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil prices the coal gasification process would become economic again

Ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Edward Streator said
He told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch the world was changing rapidly and national attitudes had to alter accordingly if growth was not to falter and world depression set in
Liberalisation of world trade in money, goods and services and technology was an overriding goal, he added
All these factors were creating major social and economic pressures and demanding a rapid reassessment of traditional attitudes, he added
At an OECD ministerial meeting in two weeks time there would be an attempt to agree global principles to help reduce this major agricultural problem, Streator said
Dutch finance minister Onno Ruding, who also spoke briefly at the lunch, stressed the importance of coordinating national policies and of the GATT talks in preventing a rapid decline into bilateralism and global protectionism

The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser said

Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination
This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability
Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation
Speculation abroad that the Bundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the for interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many economists and money market dealers within Germany
Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said
Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said
Rates and the Fed discount rate speculation
But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates
A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow suit if it happened
Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key money market rates in the next three to six months
Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further, either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest rate, allowing the market to set the rate
Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month
The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month
That should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however, they said
The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said
Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts
But a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the Bundesbank to take some action, he said
Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth
Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make the mark and mark investments less attractive
A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards
They would therefore hold off buying bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen
Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to drift lower in many European countries
Switzerland could be forced to match any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark, he said
He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy

Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of light oils because of economics and a very limited market
Not many refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils
Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil development economical, including real and stable growth in crude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved technology
And he said the most important factor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the price of crude
Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight dlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for an oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil
He said the current price differential is only about five dlrs a barrel
He said such technologies may substantially reduce current captial investment and operating costs
But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not encourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a meaningful and sustained recovery
While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range from four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic crude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and nature of the deposit are known, according to Smith
But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that everything required to build and operate the plant must come from outside the area
Currency could lead to a substantial rise in long term interest rates

Unlisted trading privileges allow trading of stocks on an exchange other than the one on which the stocks are listed
Before it would approve the Midwest Exchange request for the unlisted trading privileges, the SEC had insisted that it and the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, come up with a way of reporting and combining information on stock prices and transactions
SEC officials said they needed to be assured that  information on the trading in and price of the securities would be in one place, for accuracy and consistency
But since the exchanges still have not come with a master plan, the SEC approved an interim plan under which NASDAQ terminals would be put on the Midwest Exchange floor
The NASD, Midwest Exchange and several other exchanges have said they are working on a master plan for consolidating the reporting of price quotes and other information on stocks now traded on NASDAQ and listed on one or more exchanges
But an SEC official said such a new master reporting system is not expected to be in place until early next year
The Midwest Exchange proposed the interim reporting plan so that it can begin unlisted trading immediately, he said
Some issues listed on exchanges, however, are traded on the NASDAQ

Bangladesh is keeping its options open on whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract, but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said
The issue is expected to be decided at a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added
The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government for an extension of the shipment period because loading of wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a faulty elevator at a grain silo
But the government has not yet granted the extension, he said

Companies offering variable life insurance policies, introduced in Japan in October, look set to report sparkling results when they report on fund performance later this month, fund managers at major insurance companies said

Insurance managers said they expect variables to survive any credit market collapse since the funds should be able to react to interest rate fluctuations more quickly than huge general insurance accounts, assuming fund managers grow more sophisticated in global fund and risk management

One negative factor is that current swap conditions for marks into dollars are not favourable
Syndicate managers said the yield spread between domestic Schuldschein notes and mark eurobonds is now too low to make swaps profitable for eurobond borrowers
Low yields on domestic notes comparable to mark eurobonds mean German banks can now borrow cheaply at domestic rates
They would charge a high premium to borrowers taking up euromarks for swaps as banks have little incentive to take on more expensive euromark liabilities at present
However, some foreign borrowers might anyway borrow in marks out of a genuine need for the currency, managers said
Another factor which might dampen the primary market is uncertainty about the dollar

Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax
But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble
Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical
He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin
Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground
Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards

But in the last three years a number of new companies have announced supercomputers using some innovative technologies, and the industry finally expanded enough to hold its first World Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month
market
Supercomputers were initially designed only for the most complex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weather patterns, fusion energy research or military defense and weapons design
They are built for speed, not for standard business functions such as payroll processing
Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the machines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of air over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work
But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street brokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of supercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock trading patterns faster than any of their competitors
Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co, are now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are faster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create financial models of the stock and bond markets
Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual supercomputers are found on Wall Street
One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that supercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies provide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control Data behemoths
Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology called parallel processing, in which a number of internal processors work together to solve a problem
With such systems a problem is broken up and different segments are assigned to different processors
By contrast, standard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time, or sequentially
The processors all work on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits
It is an ideal tool for applications with many unpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for Novon Research Group

The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting
However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions
Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns
In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets
Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies

But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its obligations under the contract     PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective agrement
John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate schedule although separate agreements with the companies would favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted liftings occur
Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely concentrate on volume rather than price
Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco

European Community diplomats said the question of whether Eurobonds will fall under proposed EC rules requiring new securities issues in Community countries to be preceded by a prospectus has yet to be resolved
Securities industry has been lobbying hard against an EC Commission proposal, aimed at protecting investors, that would require publication and approval of a prospectus before all public offers of securities
The proposed directive currently includes Eurobonds, although it makes an exception to the prospectus rules for issues directed exclusively at professional investors
Diplomats said that with Britain tending towards backing West Germany and Luxembourg in their opposition to the inclusion of Eurobonds, the question of whether they would remain within the scope of the directive or not was wide open
It was not immediately clear what priority the Danes would attach to getting the proposals through during their six month tenure
Meanwhile, discussions on the directive at working group level have halted, diplomats said
Officials of the EC Commission said it recognised that its proposals created a conflict between the need for greater protection of investors, on the one hand, and for banks and other institutions to place Eurobonds quickly, on the other
Diplomats said countries that oppose the inclusion of Eurobonds in the proposals are worried that the prospectus requirements would prevent the thriving Eurobond market from functioning as well as it does now
Or Japan
Diplomats said the Eurobond question is not the only issue that needs to be resolved before the directive can be passed
The proposed rules create problems for West Germany because its new second tier securities market has less demanding requirements that would have to be tightened

district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its recapitalization
The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to repay it
Harcourt also announced an extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing
At the time, it said it was reviewing its alternatives
British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation with its advisers
British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous increase effective on the June eight record date for the dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures
British Printing also charged  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after the date
The suit also alleges that management, the board of directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price, the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase program and the manner in which its financing has been structured

A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves
That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings
Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said
Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates
Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market
An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term
However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term
At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year
Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct

One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows
The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers
The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said
Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed
A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities
It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said

The elimination of limits on daily price fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said

Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring oil which has been lost to the flood
Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break
Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River recedes
There is already evidence that the water level is dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area affecting the pipeline, Stevens said
He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil nearby, according to Stevens
He said some of this subsoil was apparently washed away
The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this line

Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy
He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct
Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply
The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said
The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year
Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices
Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation

President of the powerful and independent West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say
The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank
There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats
Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up
Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century
For Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies
The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test
But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact
He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf

Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its financing problems by devising effective instruments to compensate landowners
Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, said the rules are not expected to have a noticeable impact on the market because they only apply to dollar denominated bonds, which have been scarce recently

President,     As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate new appointment
Despite my reservations at the time, that term is in fact now almost finished
However, I do think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably convenient and consistent with an orderly transition
Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to assume office
I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for your unfailing courtesy to me personally
More broadly, your consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a particularly challenging period for it, for the financial system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever success we have had
Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those involved in economic policy
Faithfully yours,     Paul A Volcker

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said
The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said
But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves
Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany
A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said
The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve
A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said

Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his achievements over the past eight years but expressed some uncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated by President Reagan to succeed him
However, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to fill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said
Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm, Townesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration
Economy on track than Volcker
Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted countries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as familiar with the problem and the personalities involved
Commercial banks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding billions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on third world debt
News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the financial markets hard

The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a deficit this year of at least five billion European Currency Units and could be forced to choose between massive spending cuts or bankruptcy
But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that there can be no extra cash for the Community this year and instead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbs two thirds of the EC budget
A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of the budget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies, was also far from agreement, diplomats added
The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany, would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for two months
But poorer member states, which would have to borrow funds to cover the delay, complain the change in the system would unfairly impose too much of the burden on them
The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early debate on the changeover in the farm payments system, further delaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentary sources said

A Reagan administration official, who asked not to be identified, said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in the past several months to consider staying on as chairman
But there were no indications the administration had told Volcker that it was in the national interest for him to stay and that current global economic uncertainties required it
Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only have stayed on in such circumstances
One Reagan administration economic policymaker, who asked not to be named, pointed out that Baker and Greenspan worked together closely in the Ford administration
President Reagan might have been in an embarrassing position if no decision had been made by then
Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officials abroad, and is admired at the West German Bundesbank, and in Tokyo, despite his criticism  of Japanese policies
Financial markets, possibly reflecting some of the disappointment in foreign capitals, drove the dollar sharply lower on news of his departure, prompting central bank intervention to stem the fall, dealers said
Both these reasons at one time prompted him to consider stepping down before his second term was completed
But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personal reasons for his decision
In addition, Volcker would have faced four more years with a Board that he was less than comfortable with, monetary sources say
The other five members are Reagan appointees
Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration viewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to make radical policy changes
Monetary sources said the departure of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor that convinced him to stay on
Regan and Volcker clashed almost from the start of the administration

textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago
Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep
Sam Gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other Asian textile producing countries
President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year
However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation
producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, Kelly said

But because of its early development this year, Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July
Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop analysts agreed
Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later

The official, who met reporters but asked not to be identified, made clear that the use of a series of economic measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial democracies would be difficult but was a major step in cooperation
The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy
The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a step forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic behaviour that hurt other countries
But the official said influences and peer pressure could have a major impact in reforming an erring country
Economists generally believe a cooperative economic approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact on the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor countries
The official said the IMF function would be to warn countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and try to persuade them to modify it
He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very difficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and finding reasons to reduce their own exposure

Local bankers and economists say when the controls are lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and invest it freely overseas
But they warn against expectations of a sudden outflow of capital
Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of the local currency
The government spokesman said the new law does not empower authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of parliament
Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted it will be almost impossible to reimpose them
It is quite likely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form two or three large integrated blocs
In the past, production overcapacity and the intense competition between the European zinc smelters has meant they have not only been in a very weak negotiating position when buying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the metal, Bue noted
Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut down excess capacity, the burden of this on individual companies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to volunteer, he added
Another possible but very risky solution is to invest heavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said
However, some concentrate traders did express worry about their own position if the metals industry does make the move to large trading blocs

Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said
The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five pct sales tax

It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October as originally planned, they said
That policy calls on government departments to cut public investment spending by five pct per year
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be reviewed
They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public investment could lead to increased pressure on the government to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well
In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a tight grip on outlays by other government departments

Their chairman, Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker, told a press conference this morning ministers gave a majority vote in favour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposal introduced on Tuesday
However, the minority against the crucial plan for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block its adoption, and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor said other aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed
MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of an implicit indication from the West Germans that they were prepared to veto two other aspects of the package, the future monetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directly connected with common prices

Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said
The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year
The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said
This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account
However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports

The changes are needed to ensure that all financial companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial services industry
Instead, the federal government will make interim changes to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and middle income Canadians
The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that makes them less competitive, Wilson said

Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates
And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money
The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business
Up until only a few years ago
As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge
The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds
The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more
The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans
In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates
If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets
But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money
Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument
But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being
He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably
However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them
This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor
For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages
He was unable to say when the operation might begin

GTE Corp scientists said they have discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistors by creating an entirely new electronic material
Conventional transistors require many steps to make and have connections only on the surface
Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combining and heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalum disilicide, so that the two grow together
The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending througout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistor that should be superior to standard devics in high power applications, the scientists said
Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages of their research on the device, but prototypes of the new device compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and show promise of superior performance
He said the prototype device also proved to be particularly efficient in detecting light, which could open up new possibilities in solar energy conversion, the development of electronic cameras and greater efficiency in optical communication systems

Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said

And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices
But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week
Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago
With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said
Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles

President Reagan said he had ordered the administration to begin talks with congressional leaders on a budget deficit reduction plan
Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget law, but preferred to negotiate with Congress
He said he would consider anything the congressional leadership proposed, but a spokesman said he remains opposed to raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit

Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally in any negotiations with Congress

British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary resources
British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting in December
Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea, although several other EC states back it in outline
Howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar
The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations
French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve

EC agriculture ministers attacked plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that cereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said
They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing spending on the cereals regime
The sources said several ministers complained that changing price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage the financial security of farmers
But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security regardless of market circumstances
The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need for some output ceilings
However, the French and Dutch ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of cereal crops, rather than for cereals alone
The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings for individual countries with excess production being paid for from national exchequers, but received no support for this idea
British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he detected more support for his position against the penalties on farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility levies
He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for farmers could help in this direction

Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio insurance
The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investors at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to a future course of action such as buying a put option
While negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build for months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow span of time, because they are executed as the market starts to fall
Miller said at present people can only guess how much portfolio insurance is in use
He suggested some system of disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds were being planted that might add to a future decline
But in any case Miller argued that index futures and options do not initiate market trends

Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord

West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact
They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States
interest rate trends, but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation, bank economists said
This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger
In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit, the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning
